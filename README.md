# Friendly Social Network

## Description 
---

It is an established fact these days that the usage of internet-base social media has become an inseperable part of the daily human life. The application here serves as a back-end for a social network web application. The users can be defined, they can share their thoughts, make a friends' list, and they can share their opinions about their friends' thoughts. 

<br>

3 schemas and 2 models are designed in this program:

1. a schema for user and a model based on that

2. a schema fot thought and a model based on that

3. a schema for reaction

<br>

The relationship between them is as follows:

- Each user can have multiple thoughts and each thought belongs to one user. (**one-to-many** relationship between the model of user and the model of thought)

- Each thought can have multiple reactions.

- Each user can have multiple friends. (**self-reference** relationship in the model of user)

<br>

This application can handle the following requests:

1. create a user

2. update a user

3. delete a user resulting in deletion of their thoughts and their id from the friends' list of the other users

4. get all users

5. get a user by its id

6. create a thought

7. update an existing thought

8. delete a thought resulting in deletion of its id from the thoughts' list of the related user

9. get all thoughts

10. get a thought by its id

11. create a friend

12. delete a frend

13. create a reaction to a thought

14. delete a reaction to a thought

15. show the friends' count of each user

16. show the reactions' count of each thought
